# Tideland changelog

## 0.2.1 — 2026-09-11

Cross-device camera/settings patch.

- Preserved the current world FOV behaviour that is working correctly on the Windows reference build.
- Added held-item/viewmodel FOV, invert Y and optional head bob.
- Added render scale, dynamic shadows, crosshair opacity and compass controls.
- Added Reset Camera, Reset Settings and Reload Latest Build controls.
- Added version/build identification to F3 telemetry for PC/Mac comparison.
- Existing settings migrate to safe defaults for the new fields; world saves are untouched.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-09-11

Reconciliation update combining the useful local Codex work with the newer GitHub camera/movement and Pages fixes.

- Restored direct vertical FOV control (`60°–100°`) so the setting has the strong, immediate effect expected from the original build.
- Preserved the corrected yaw-based WASD movement fix.
- Completed station placement collision checks against resources, player structures, survival stations and landmarks.
- Stations clear grass under their footprint and the world has a 500-station safety limit.
- Improved landmark placement/spacing and safer debug teleporting to POIs.
- Smoother independent rain/fog/storm transitions and animated station fire.
- Added workbench-specific recipes and cleaner first-person handling of station kits.
- Added GitHub Pages auto-deployment, visible version/build information and an in-game History panel.
- Expanded survival browser QA for station placement and persistence.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-09-08

Initial early-access survival foundation: procedural island, gathering, crafting, building, stations, weather, local saves, map/waypoints, first-person viewmodel, diagnostics and QA tooling.
